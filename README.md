# Okotti_platformer_scripts
Scripts ripped out of my Okotti platformer, in case anyone wants to check or learn something.
It´s all WIP, but if you´ve played the game and noticed some funky effects, here´s your chance to rip thru my files.

The codebase uses FMOD for audio and Cinemachine for the cameras, so that explains some of the weird choices.
